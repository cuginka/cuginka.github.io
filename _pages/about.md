# About Me

I am a third-year undergraduate in Applied Psychology at Ningbo University, aspiring to be a researcher at the intersection of psycholinguistics and artificial intelligence.

My core academic passion is to investigate whether the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) can serve as valid computational models for human language cognition. I plan to pursue a research-based Master's or PhD program in this field and am always open to collaborations and discussions.

## Research Interests

My interests are unified by the goal of building a computational understanding of human language processing.

- **Computational Psycholinguistics**: Using computational models (especially LLMs) to test theories about human language acquisition, comprehension, and production.

- **Cognitive Science**: Benchmarking the similarities and differences between human and machine cognition, particularly in how meaning (semantics) is represented and processed.

- **Methodology**: Applying techniques like Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and fine-tuning pre-trained models to bridge brain, behavior, and AI data.

## Research Experience

### Lead Researcher | The Conceptual Structure of Chinese Kinship: A Modern-Ancient Comparison using PLMs
*Sep 2024 - Present*

- Led an independent project investigating the historical evolution of kinship concepts in Chinese culture.
- Utilized Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), including modern (e.g., RoBERTa) and ancient text-trained models (e.g., GuwenBERT), to extract semantic representations.
- Applied Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare model-derived conceptual structures with human behavioral data, aiming to map the cognitive shifts between traditional and modern perspectives.

### Project Member | Multimodal AI for Visual-Linguistic Understanding
*Summer 2024, Peking University*

- Selected for the competitive summer school program, "Large Models: From Fundamental to Frontier," at Peking University.
- Developed a project where a multimodal AI model was trained to play a "Pictionary-style" guessing game, exploring its capabilities in joint visual and linguistic understanding.

## Education

- **B.S. in Applied Psychology** - Ningbo University, 2023-2027 (Expected)
- **Summer School** - Peking University, Large Models: From Fundamental to Frontier, 2025
