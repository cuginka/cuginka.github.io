## Education

- **B.S. in Applied Psychology** - Ningbo University, 2023-2027 (Expected)
- **Summer School** - Peking University, Large Models: From Fundamental to Frontier, 2025

## Research Experience

### Lead Researcher | The Conceptual Structure of Chinese Kinship: A Modern-Ancient Comparison using PLMs
*Sep 2024 - Present*

- Led an independent research project investigating the historical evolution of kinship concepts in Chinese culture, bridging cognitive science with computational linguistics.
- Utilized Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), including modern (e.g., RoBERTa) and ancient text-trained models (e.g., GuwenBERT), to extract and analyze semantic representations of kinship terms.
- Applied Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) as the core methodology to compare model-derived conceptual structures with human behavioral data, aiming to quantitatively map the cognitive shifts between traditional and modern perspectives.

### Core Project Member | Multimodal AI for Visual-Linguistic Understanding: "AI Pictionary"
*Summer 2025, Peking University*

- Selected for the competitive summer school program, "Large Models: From Fundamental to Frontier," at Peking University.
- Designed and implemented a multi-agent AI system where an image-to-text model (Doubao) generated descriptive riddles, and multiple text-to-image models (Baidu Qianfan, Tongyi Wanxiang, Zhipu CogView) competed to recreate the image from the description.
- Developed a modular Python application with object-oriented design, creating an abstraction layer (AIModels class) to unify diverse API calls and manage different AI providers, demonstrating strong skills in system integration and software engineering.
